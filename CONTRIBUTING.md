## Building the Action

This action uses `@vercel/ncc` to compile all dependencies into a single file:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Important:** Always run `npm run build` before committing! The `dist/index.js` file must be kept in sync with your source changes.

## Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have automated tests. When testing your changes:

1. Create a test repository with Vercel deployments
2. Add a workflow that uses your modified action
3. Test various scenarios (PR deployments, branch deployments, etc.)
4. Verify the action behaves as expected

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Open a pull request against the `main` branch
3. Fill in the pull request template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Motivation and context
   - How you tested the changes
